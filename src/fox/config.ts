/**
 * fox — trait declaration and resolver for a deterministic flat-design fox bust.
 *
 * Like meowtar, built on the core engine and rendered to SVG — but drawn with
 * the svg.js element API (see ./draw) rather than string concatenation, so the
 * exact same drawing code runs in the browser against the real DOM and headless
 * in Node via svgdom (see ./render). Flip any trait between fixed and seed-driven
 * by editing its constructor.
